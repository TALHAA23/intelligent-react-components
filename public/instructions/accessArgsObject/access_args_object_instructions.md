## Accessing User-Defined Elements via the `args` Object

The generated JavaScript function will receive user-defined elements (variables, utils (aliases), mutations, and callbacks) through the `args` object (the second argument). Direct referencing of these elements within the generated function is not allowed. All access must be through the `args` object.

### Guidelines for Accessing User-Defined Elements:

**[SUPPORTING_PROPS_ACCESS]**

**[MUTATION_ACCESS]**

**[CALLBACKS_ACCESS]**
