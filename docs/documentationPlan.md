Welcome to the Documentation Plan for Our Project!

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to help you navigate our project's documentation effortlessly. It outlines the structure and organization of our documentation, covering four key areas:

1. **Component Documentation**
2. **Helper Function Documentation**
3. **Server Documentation**
4. **JSDoc**

## Component Documentation

For each component, a documentation will be structured in this way:

### Introduction

- Overview of the component
- Purpose

### Usage Guide

- Component functionalities
- Step-by-step examples
- Best practices and tips

### API Reference

- Detailed description of classes, functions, and methods
- Parameters, return values, and usage examples
- Error handling and exceptions

### Troubleshooting

- Common issues and solutions
- Troubleshooting tips

### Customization and Configuration

- Options for customizing components
- Configuration settings and their effects

So for a component documentation, you can expect all the help from starting to using and changing it to your needs. A blueprint of the component will also be provided, which shows what the component expects and what you should expect. For instance, a data structure will look like this:

| Field       | Type        | Description                       |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `fieldname` | `fieldtype` | An a description on how to use it |

Such tables will describe the interface of a component so it's easy to understand what a component expects and gives a desired output.

## Helper Function Documentation

Helper functions are methods that are usually placed in `utils` and `lib`. These functions help components to complete a task and are reusable as many times as possible. Now, documentation of such functions will be in a separate place called the **Helper Function Documentation** and will not be placed in the component documentation itself.

To ensure easy navigation, **component documentation** will use **references** so you can easily navigate to any helper function and read about it.

Now you may be reading the documentation from any of the following sources given below. Each tells you how to reference the documentation:

1. **Notion:** Notion readers can find the helper function using **internal links** or **database references**. For instance, you may see "read more @helperfunction". Clicking on it will open the documentation.
2. **GitHub:** Markdown links will take you to the desired page.
3. **Hardcopy:** A detailed index or table of contents will help you quickly locate relevant information.

## Server Documentation

As the library also has a server that the user uses, you can find separate server-related documentation. In a server documentation, you can find the following information:

### Overview

- A high-level overview of server functionalities and a guide on using it.

### API Reference

- Endpoints: List all available endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Request Parameters: Describe the expected request parameters for each endpoint, including data types and required/optional fields.
- Response Format: Specify the format of the responses (e.g., JSON, XML) and the expected data structure.
- Error Handling: Explain how errors are handled and what status codes are returned.

### Configuration

- Configuration Options: List any available configuration options and their default values.
- Example Configuration: Provide an example configuration file to illustrate how to configure the server.

### Usage

- Guide on how to start the server.

You will also see some tables like:

**Supported Endpoints**

| HTTP method | Endpoint    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `POST`      | create-file |
| `GET`       | activity    |

**Responses**

| Field   | Type       | Description                       |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `event` | `function` | An a description on how to use it |

**Status Codes**

A detailed list of all possible status codes and what they mean:

- **Success Code**

| HTTP Status Code | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `200`            | Successfully processed request. |

- **Error Codes**

| HTTP Status Code | `code`              | `message`                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `400`            | invalid_json        | The request body could not be decoded as JSON |
| `400`            | invalid_request_url | This request URL is not valid.                |

## JSDocs

JSDocs are documentation accessible with code. Hover on a function to open a box that details what the function is about. It contains:

- Params
- Return
- Description
- Examples

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a book.
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} title - The title of the book.
 * @param {string} author - The author of the book.
 */
function Book(title, author) {}
```

---

That's all about the documentation plan. This plan will help you know what kind of support is available.
