## Using the `globals` Field

The `globals` field in the response JSON is used to store variables to persist their state, references, or functions that to be reused across multiple generated function. These globals are accessible within any generated function and can be Accessed as `globals.[variable_name]`.

**Defining Globals:**

Define variables, references, or functions in the `globals` field by assigning a value to a key. Use descriptive key names. For example:

```json
{
  "globals": {
    "GLOBAL_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE_KEY": "GLOBAL_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE_VALUE",
    "dataStore": {}
  }
}
```

## Use Cases:

- Maintaining State: Track a variable's value across multiple calls to the main function. For example, GLOBALS_USECASE_EXAMPLE.
